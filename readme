Avis Drupal 8 theme starter kit readme file.

If u already don't have install these:

 - node js with command "sudo apt-get install nodejs";
 - npm with "sudo apt-get install npm";
 - gulp with "sudo npm install gulp -g" or u may don't install it and use it locally with command "npm run gulp";
 - bower "sudo npm install -g bower".

After that run "npm install" and "bower install" in the directory with package.json and bower.json.

And u ready to rock. Run "gulp"(or "npm run gulp" if u don't install gulp globally) for magic.
You can see other gulp tasks in gulpfile.js.
